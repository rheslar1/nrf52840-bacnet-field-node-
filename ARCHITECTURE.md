# Architecture

## Objective

Build a portfolio-ready C++17 model of an nRF52840 BACnet field node that can grow into hardware firmware while remaining testable on a normal development machine.

The project is not a toy print-only scaffold. It contains a real domain model for:

- Retained commissioning configuration.
- BACnet object mapping.
- Battery and low-power behavior.
- Writable setpoint safety.
- Host-side persistence.
- Commissioning evidence.

## System Context

```text

        |
        | BACnet object values, setpoint writes, commissioning state
        v

        |
        | C++17 domain model
        v
Sensors, retained storage, battery, BLE/BACnet bridge
```

The host simulator stands in for hardware drivers. That lets the project prove design quality, object contracts, validation, and documentation before board-specific work begins.

## Key Types

### `FieldNode`

Coordinates retained config, live sensor sample, battery profile, commissioning, object mapping, storage, and reports. It is the main API used by CLI, tests, and future firmware integration.

### `RetainedConfig`

Represents data that must survive reset:

- Device instance.
- Vendor ID.
- BACnet object base instance.
- Setpoint bounds and retained setpoints.
- Transmit interval.
- BACnet MAC identity.
- BLE address.
- Zone and room labels.
- Commissioning state.
- Checksum.

### `BacnetObjectMapper`

Maps the current node state to a stable BACnet-style object table. It does not own config or sensor state, which keeps mapping logic testable.

### `IConfigStorage`

Abstracts retained storage. The host implementation uses a text file. A hardware implementation can write to Nordic FDS, internal flash, or an external EEPROM without changing `FieldNode`.

### `ISetpointPolicy`

Allows setpoint behavior to vary. The default `ClampedSetpointPolicy` constrains writes inside configured min/max comfort bounds.

## C++ Design Patterns

![C++17 SOLID and pattern map](docs/diagrams/cpp-solid-patterns.png)

### Strategy

`ISetpointPolicy` is a strategy interface. The default policy clamps setpoints, but a future policy could apply occupancy schedules, demand response rules, or BEMS-ai recommendations.

### Repository / Adapter

`IConfigStorage` decouples the domain model from storage details. `FileConfigStorage` is the host adapter. Nordic FDS or EEPROM would be another adapter.

### Mapper

`BacnetObjectMapper` converts domain state into BACnet-facing object values. This avoids mixing building-protocol representation with application state.

### Service Object

`CommissioningService` owns provisioning and lock rules, including the rule that a locked node cannot be reprovisioned.

### Facade

`FieldNode` gives the CLI and tests a simple facade over several internal services.

## SOLID Design Notes

- `BatteryEstimator` only estimates battery state.
- `BacnetObjectMapper` only builds BACnet object views.
- `CommissioningService` only changes commissioning state.
- `FileConfigStorage` only persists and loads config.
- `FieldNode` coordinates these objects instead of doing every job itself.

## Future Firmware Mapping

| Current Host Type | nRF52840 Firmware Counterpart |
| --- | --- |
| `FileConfigStorage` | Nordic FDS, flash page storage, or external EEPROM |
| `SensorSample` | SAADC/I2C/SPI/BLE sensor reads |
| `BacnetObjectMapper` | BACnet gateway payload table |
| `CommissioningService` | BLE provisioning characteristic handler |
| `main.cpp` CLI | RTOS task, Zephyr shell, or Nordic app main |
| CTest | Host unit tests plus HIL smoke tests |

## Safety Boundaries

![Commissioning and retained storage flow](docs/diagrams/commissioning-storage-flow.png)

- Setpoint writes are clamped.
- Config checksum must match before load succeeds.
- Locked nodes reject reprovisioning.
- Sensor sample ranges reject impossible values.
- Low-battery state is exposed as a BACnet binary value.

## C++17, Design Patterns, and SOLID Implementation

This repository includes a host-buildable C++17 implementation, not only documentation. The implementation applies:

- Strategy pattern for validation rules.
- Adapter interfaces for input samples and telemetry/reporting.
- Composite validation for combining safety and readiness checks.
- Facade orchestration through the project runtime class.
- SOLID boundaries between profile data, input acquisition, validation, telemetry encoding, and tests.
